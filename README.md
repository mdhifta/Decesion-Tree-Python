# Decision Tree

I got a data for credit card approval from my friend. At that time I thought to make a simple analysis using the Decision Tree method, one of the classification methods to provide a decision.

The data I get includes:
Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area, Loan_Status

then, I process this data using python, if you want to run this code, there are a few things you have to prepare:

* Python 3.6^
* Jupyter Notebook -> https://jupyter.org/install
* Pandas -> pip install pandas
* Scikit-learn -> pip install scikit-learn
* Pydotplus -> pip install pydotplus
